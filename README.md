# Xamkflix -streaming app

The project has developed as part of my studies.
A streaming service for movies that includes common functionalities found in streaming platforms such as browsing, search, login, and watchlists. 
The app does not have video streaming capabilities. 
The data for the application is sourced from its own databases, APIs, and The Movie Database (tMDb) service API.

There are few screenshots of application in screenshots -folder.

The techniques I used in implementing the application:
- Next.js 13
- Supabase
- Tailwind CSS
