# Xamkflix -streaming app

A streaming service for movies that includes common functionalities found in streaming platforms such as browsing, search, login, and watchlists. 
The app does not have video streaming capabilities. 
The data for the application is sourced from its own databases, APIs, and The Movie Database (tMDb) service API.
(A school project)

The techniques I used in implementing the application:
- Next.js 13
- Supabase
- Tailwind CSS
